# Microscope application

## JavaFX microscope application for recording and analysing pictures from a digital microscope.

The desktop application allows users to view camera images from an IZOXIS USB microscope, take and save photos, and analyse images. Below is an example of analysing a photo taken in the application. In the first step, the image is binarized, followed by dilation, erosion, and applying the canny filter. The project was created with [Piotr CiÄ™gotura](https://github.com/Ciegotura).

### Features
* two windows, one for a camera view in real-time and one for image analysis
* snapping
* binarization of the image with a selected threshold
* median filter, canny filter
* erosion, dilation
* saving to local disk
* loading from local disk
